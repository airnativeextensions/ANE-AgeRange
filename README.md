# AgeRange

The [AgeRange](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.AgeRange) extension gives you access to 
Google's *Play Age Signals API* and Apple's *Declared Age Range API* to request people to share their age range with your app.

*These tools are designed to help you meet compliance obligations under certain age verification laws in jurisdictions like Texas, Utah, and Louisiana in the United States. Developers are responsible for ensuring their use of the API is compliant with all applicable regulations and Google Play policies.*

This extension gives you the tools to assess a user's age range and adapt your application appropriately.

We provide complete guides to get you up and running with age requests quickly and easily.


### Features

- Google's *Play Age Signals API* on Android;
- Apple's *Declared Age Range API* on iOS and macOS;
- Single API interface - your code works across supported platforms with no modifications
- Sample project code and ASDocs reference

As with all our extensions you get access to a year of support and updates as we are 
continually improving and updating the extensions for OS updates and feature requests.
